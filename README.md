# Javascript

In this repository I keep some small Javascript projects and exercises.
## /Vanilla
In this subfolder I keep every project and exercise made with pure Javascript/CSS/HTML , without any library.

 - **1_ColorFlipper**
 
A small web project where the user can randomly change the background color with a button press.

*In this project I utilized the Math.random() function to generate a random float decimal and converted it to hexadecimal within the hexadecimal color range.*

 - **2_Contador**
 
A simple counter where the user can add, subtract and reset the counter.

*In this project I utilizes the this keyword.*

 - **3_Testemunhos**
 
A simple testimonial section, where the user can loop through the items in order using the left or right buttons, and randomly with a separate button.

*In this project I fed the data through an array of dictionaries and loop through it acordingly the direction. Used the Math.floor function together with the Math.random to generate the random array position.*

 - **4_Navbar**
 
A responsive navbar.

*In this project I implemented a arrow function on the window event 'resize'. Learned about the CSS Specifity, with the overlap of the 'display' style via javascript and It also made me remember some CSS animation elements, like transform, transition, etc.*

 - **5_Sidebar**
 
A dinamic sidebar.

*In this project I made a sidebar the would slide-in based on the click event of the hamburger icon. I used CSS Keyframes to make the animations of the hamburger icon and the slide-in effect of the sidebar. Used javascript to manipulate the css styles.*

 - **6_Modal**
 
A simple modal box.

*In this project I made a simple modal box. The animations for the modal's fade in and for the close button were made in css with keyframes and I used javascript to manipulate the css attributes.*

 - **7_Q&A**
 
A responsive and interative Q&A page.

*In this project I used nested arrow functions and the forEach method to manipulate the elements corresponding each button's card.*

 - **8_Menu**
 
A interative menu page.

*In this project I fed the data via Javascrit through an array of objects. Used the DOMContentLoaded event to display all content on page load, and then used the filter method to dynamically filter the array based on the button pressed. To display the array on the page I used the map method to concatenate the html blocks.
