# Javascript

In this repository I keep some small Javascript projects and exercises.
## /Vanilla
In this subfolder I keep every project and exercise made with pure Javascript/CSS/HTML , without any library.

 - **1_ColorFlipper**
 
A small web project where the user can randomly change the background color with a button press.

*In this project I utilized the Math.random() function to generate a random float decimal and converted it to hexadecimal within the hexadecimal color range.*

 - **2_Contador**
 
A simple counter where the user can add, subtract and reset the counter.

*In this project I utilizes the this keyword.*

 - **3_Testemunhos**
 
A simple testimonial section, where the user can loop through the items in order using the left or right buttons, and randomly with a separate button.

*In this project I fed the data through an array of dictionaries and loop through it acordingly the direction. Used the Math.floor function together with the Math.random to generate the random array position.*

 - **4_Navbar**
 
A responsive navbar.

*In this project I learned that I couldn't just show the mobile-nav by overlaping the CSS style 'display:none', I had to create a separate class with the display style and remove/add it accordingly the button press.
This project was also good to remember some CSS animation elements, like transform, transition, etc.*
